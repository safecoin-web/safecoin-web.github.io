      <p><strong>I bought with bitcoins, where are my MaidSafeCoins?</strong>
        <br/>
    Your MaidSafeCoins can be tracked on <a href="https://masterchest.info/">masterchest.info</a> and we will be updating our <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/maidsafe.net/spreadsheets/d/1r4fv57JDNkW55P5dnwPmHF3rOhdt1Jn5I2DZFuZfmfU/edit">Google document spreadsheet</a> as frequently as possible. Apologies for the delay in getting the MaidSafeCoin out, and thanks to everyone involved for your patience.</p>
    <p><strong>I bought with Mastercoins, where are my MaidSafeCoins?</strong>
    <br/>
    Your MaidSafeCoins will have been issued automatically. If you haven&rsquo;t received them it may mean you were too late and you should expect a refund of Mastercoins. Check <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/maidsafe.net/spreadsheets/d/1r4fv57JDNkW55P5dnwPmHF3rOhdt1Jn5I2DZFuZfmfU/edit#gid=100304653" target="_blank">here</a> for an up to date list of the transactions being refunded.</p>
    <p><strong>How do I check my MaidSafeCoin balance?</strong>
    <br/>To check your balance please visit <a href="https://masterchest.info/">masterchest.info</a> and input your wallet address or transaction ID. Your MaidSafeCoins should show as SPT (Smart Property Token).</p>
    <p><strong>How do I get a MaidSafeCoin compatible wallet?</strong>
    <br/>
    You can get a MaidSafeCoin compatible wallet by going to <a href="http://www.mastercoin.org/">mastercoin.org</a> or <a href="https://test.omniwallet.org">ominiwallet</a> (alpha) and follow the instructions on their website.</p>
    <p><strong>I can&rsquo;t see MaidSafeCoin in my wallet?</strong>
    <br/>Not all wallets are MaidSafeCoin compatible. To view your coins you should go to masterchest.info and input your wallet address.</p>
    <p><strong>My coins aren&rsquo;t showing on Masterchain?</strong> <br/>
      The current version (0.3) does not yet recognise the smart property token, which is what MaidSafeCoins come under. Once 0.4 is released you will be able to see your coins in the wallet.</p>
 
    
    <hr class="featurette-divider" id="div2">

    <h3>Trade</h3>
<p><strong>Can I trade MaidSafeCoins?</strong>
<br/>Yes trading has already begun on masterxchange website <a href="https://masterxchange.com/market.php?currency=maid">here</a>. You will need to register an account in order to do so.</p>

      <h3>Help</h3>
    <p><strong>What is my MaidSafeCoin address?</strong>
    <br/>Your MaidSafeCoin address is the public address you used to purchase your coins from. You can find this in your wallet application.</p>
    <p><strong>What address will my MaidSafeCoins be sent to?</strong>
    <br/>They will be sent be sent to the address you completed the transaction from. Unless you have sent it from an exchange (e.g. Coinbase).</p>
    <p><strong>What if I have used an Exchange to purchase MaidSafeCoins?</strong>
    <br/>If your transaction hasn&rsquo;t yet been completed you might still be able to get a refund. Unfortunately if the transaction has been completed your MaidSafeCoins will have been destroyed. Our instructions explicitly stated that participants should only use wallets where you have full control of your private keys.    </p>
    <p><strong>What does SPT stand for?</strong>
      <br/>Smart Property Token</p>
    <p><strong>Was I too late to take part in the crowd sale?</strong>
    <br/>You can check our <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/maidsafe.net/spreadsheets/d/1r4fv57JDNkW55P5dnwPmHF3rOhdt1Jn5I2DZFuZfmfU/edit#gid=1074972288">Google document spreadsheet</a> to see if your transaction made it in time. If not you will be refunded.</p>
    <p><strong>When can I start farming?</strong>
    <br/>We are aiming to launch a test network in the next couple of weeks and through the course of the next couple of months will test the network fully. Our full beta launch will happen soon after and at this point you will be able to contribute your resources to the network and become a farmer. This will be a simple process and effectively will involve a simple software download although we will provide more comprehensive instructions nearer the time.</p>

      <p class="lead">safecoin is the crypto currency of the SAFE (Secure Access For Everyone) network.</p>
      <p>The SAFE network takes all the Internet services currently available today and decentralizes them, removing servers and other central points of weakness enabling privacy, security and anonymity to all Internet users for the first time.</p>
      <p>safecoin is a fair and transparent way of giving <a href="#div3">end users</a>, <a href="#div4">developers</a> and <a href="#div2">backers</a> the opportunity to get involved with SAFE network. safecoins may be earned, traded or purchased and a total
        cap of 4.3 billion will be generated.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Backers <span class="muted">Purchase safecoins</span></h2>
      <p>It is also possible to buy safecoin and buyers anywhere in the world will be given the opportunity to do so during an up and coming crowd-sale. The sale event will run until ten percent of all safecoins (429,496,729) are sold or 30 days have passed,
        which ever happens first. safecoin will be made available to buyers through a proxy token, MaidSafeCoin. Once the MaidSafe network goes live, the MaidSafeCoins will be redeemable for the network&rsquo;s native safecoins at a 1-to-1 ratio.
      </p>
      <p>The crowd sale will commence at 9 am GMT on the 22nd of April. Purchases can be made using either bitcoin or mastercoin with all purchases being recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, via the Master protocol. It will be possible to trade MaidSafeCoin
        immediately, and this intermediary coin will remain while the SAFE test network remains in place.</p>
        <h3 id="buyers-guide">Buyers Guide</h3>
        <ol>
  <li>You will need to have bitcoins or mastercoins to participate as a Backer in the MaidSafeCoin crowd sale. You should obtain bitcoins or mastercoins from a source that you trust. Great info is available here: <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/getting-started">bitcoin.org/en/getting-started</a> and <a href="http://www.mastercoin.org/">mastercoin.org</a></li>
  <li>Once you have your bitcoins or mastercoins, go to <a href="http://www.buysafecoins.com/" target="_blank">buysafecoins.com</a></li>
  <li>At 9AM GMT, Tuesday 22nd April, two SAFE Network &ldquo;exodus&rdquo; addresses will be published, one for Bitcoin, and one for Mastercoin.</li>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">End Users <span class="muted">Proof of Resource</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">End users can farm (or earn) safecoins by providing Proof of Resource (POR).</p>
      <p>In many crypto currencies and decentralized networks a proof of something is required to allow the network to validate actions or services via a mathematically verifiable mechanism. Within the SAFE network, nodes (users computers) are validated
        in a very efficient, accurate and cryptographically secure manner.  End users can earn safecoin by contributing resources to the network, we call these resource providers &lsquo;farmers&rsquo;. Farmers provide these resources by running a vault
        (a node on the network) which handles requests and stores data for other users. There is no set up required to turn your computer into a vault, it is just a simple software download.</p>
      <p>The resources in question are storage, CPU, online time and bandwidth. The SAFE network is able to constantly measure and immediately verify these resources, this is called Proof of Resource (POR). This POR facilitates the exchange of storage space
        on the SAFE network. To earn safecoin, farmers must provide more resources than they are using and the amount of safecoin they earn directly relates to the amount of resource they are providing. There are no humans involved in this process and
        the network stores data randomly across all nodes, similar to a lottery. The more resources you provide the more lottery tickets you have! </p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Developers <span class="muted">for safecoin</span></h2>
      <p>15% of all safecoin earned will be allocated to the developer pool. This will ensure the developer community is highly motivated and rewarded for providing free-to-use applications as their revenue model. It is proposed that developers are able to use the SAFE network to publish their applications. These application developers are called Builders and the network will reward use of these applications by paying the Builders in safecoin based on the application use by users of the system. This is possible since the application developer can insert their own network immutable wallet address in their application. This exciting proposal may be a fully automatic revenue model for both open source projects, private individuals and application development companies. Developers who contribute code that enhances or fixes bugs in the SAFE network that are accepted into the master branch of the codebase will also be able to earn safecoin. </p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">FAQs <span class="muted">What would you like to know?</span></h2>
      <p><strong>How can I become a backer of safecoin?</strong>
      <p class="last-para">Backers can participate in the crowd sale by sending either bitcoin or mastercoin to the relevant address, published on <a href="http://www.buysafecoins.com">www.buysafecoins.com</a> as the sale starts. Two addresses will be published, one for bitcoin, and one for mastercoin. As the funds are received MaidSafeCoins will be issued and sent to the address used to send the coins. Please note that it may take up to 24 hours for these transactions to be processed.  Once the full SAFE network is launched, MaidSafeCoins will be swapped for safecoins at a 1:1 ratio.
</p>
      <p><strong>How will I receive my MaidSafeCoins during the crowd-sale?</strong>
      <p class="last-para">MaidSafeCoins are generated and distributed via the Master Protocol on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, so your Bitcoin address will also be your MaidSafeCoin address. In order to view your balance and send your tokens, you will need to use a Mastercoin
        wallet, such as Masterchest (for Windows) or Masterchain.info (web wallet for Mac and Linux users). These wallets will support MaidSafeCoins upon commencement of the crowd-sale.</p>
      <p><strong>When should I purchase MaidSafeCoins?</strong>
      <p>The crowd-sale of MaidSafeCoin has an early backer incentive mechanism. Early backers will receive additional MaidSafeCoins for their purchase on the following scale:</p>

      <table class="table half-w">
        <tr>
          <td>First Week Incentive:</td>
          <td>40% bonus</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Second Week Incentive:</td>
          <td>30% bonus</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Third Week Incentive:</td>
          <td>20% bonus</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Fourth Week Incentive:</td>
          <td>10% bonus</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>For the coin issuance we are utilising the block chain via the master protocol. The bonus algorithm works by applying a 40% bonus in the first block, 39.99% bonus in the next block..etc., down to 30% bonus for the first block in week 2.</p>
      <p class="last-para">Up to 429,496,729 MaidSafeCoins will be generated during this crowd-sale. Once this number is reached the crowd-sale will end, so there is an incentive to become involved early.</p>
      <p><strong>Where can I trade my MaidSafeCoins once they are purchased?</strong>
      <p class="last-para">You will be able to exchange your MaidSafeCoins for safecoins once the SAFE Network is launched, and you will also be able to trade your MaidSafeCoins immediately upon receipt at exchanges that support MaidSafeCoin. MasterXchange.com is an exchange
        that will support MaidSafeCoin immediately once the crowd-sale has begun, so once your purchase has occurred you will be able to trade your MaidSafeCoins immediately. You will be able to send your MaidSafeCoins to any Bitcoin address (using a
        Mastercoin wallet) as soon as they are received by you.</p>
      <p><strong>What is the Master Protocol?</strong>
      <p>The Master Protocol, developed by the Mastercoin Foundation, facilitates the creation and trading of smart properties and user currencies as well as other types of smart contracts by encoding information directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
      <p class="last-para">The Master Protocol is decentralized, and like safecoin, “removes the middlemen” in network transactions, with a focus on transactions that occur on the Bitcoin blockchain. Mastercoin and the Master Protocol are driven by the community and leverages
        the decentralization of the network to provide value and increased functionality.</p>
