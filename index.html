      <p class="lead">safecoin is the crypto currency of the SAFE (Secure Access For Everyone) network.</p>
      <p>The SAFE network takes all the Internet services currently available today and decentralizes them, removing servers and other central points of weakness enabling privacy, security and anonymity to all Internet users for the first time.</p>
      <p>safecoin is a fair and transparent way of giving <a href="#div3">end users</a>, <a href="#div4">developers</a> and <a href="#div2">backers</a> the opportunity to get involved with SAFE network. safecoins may be earned, traded or purchased and a total
        cap of 4.3 billion will be generated.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Backers <span class="muted">Purchase safecoins</span></h2>
      <p>It is also possible to buy safecoin and buyers anywhere in the world will be given the opportunity to do so during an up and coming crowd-sale. The sale event will run until ten percent of all safecoins (429,496,729) are sold or 30 days have passed,
        which ever happens first. safecoin will be made available to buyers through a proxy token, MaidSafeCoin. Once the MaidSafe network goes live, the MaidSafeCoins will be redeemable for the network&rsquo;s native safecoins at a 1-to-1 ratio.
      </p>
      <p>The crowd sale will commence at 9 am GMT on the 22nd of April. Purchases can be made using either bitcoin or mastercoin with all purchases being recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, via the Master protocol. It will be possible to trade MaidSafeCoin
        immediately, and this intermediary coin will remain while the SAFE test network remains in place.</p>
        <h3 id="buyers-guide">Buyers Guide</h3>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">End Users <span class="muted">Proof of Resource</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">End users can farm (or earn) safecoins by providing Proof of Resource (POR).</p>
      <p>In many crypto currencies and decentralized networks a proof of something is required to allow the network to validate actions or services via a mathematically verifiable mechanism. Within the SAFE network, nodes (users computers) are validated
        in a very efficient, accurate and cryptographically secure manner.  End users can earn safecoin by contributing resources to the network, we call these resource providers &lsquo;farmers&rsquo;. Farmers provide these resources by running a vault
        (a node on the network) which handles requests and stores data for other users. There is no set up required to turn your computer into a vault, it is just a simple software download.</p>
      <p>The resources in question are storage, CPU, online time and bandwidth. The SAFE network is able to constantly measure and immediately verify these resources, this is called Proof of Resource (POR). This POR facilitates the exchange of storage space
        on the SAFE network. To earn safecoin, farmers must provide more resources than they are using and the amount of safecoin they earn directly relates to the amount of resource they are providing. There are no humans involved in this process and
        the network stores data randomly across all nodes, similar to a lottery. The more resources you provide the more lottery tickets you have! </p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Developers <span class="muted">for safecoin</span></h2>
      <p>15% of all safecoin earned will be allocated to the developer pool. This will ensure the developer community is highly motivated and rewarded for providing free-to-use applications as their revenue model. It is proposed that developers are able
        to use the SAFE network to publish their applications. These application developers are called Builders and the network will reward use of these applications by paying the Builders in safecoin based on the application use by users of the system.
        This is calculated as the application developer can insert their own wallet address in their application (which becomes immutable) on the network. This exciting proposal may be a fully automatic revenue model for both open source projects, private
        individuals and application development companies. Developers who contribute code that enhances or fixes bugs in the SAFE network that are accepted into the master branch of the codebase will also be able to earn safecoin.

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">FAQs <span class="muted">What would you like to know?</span></h2>
      <h3>How can I become a backer of safecoin?</h3>
      <p class="last-para">During the crowd-sale, backers can participate two different ways: by sending bitcoins to our crowd-sale website or by sending mastercoins to our crowd-sale “exodus address.&quot; Purchases using Mastercoin will occur on-blockchain, and MaidSafeCoins
        will be instantly delivered to the backer. Bitcoin purchases will occur using the buysafecoins.com website, and backers will provide the Bitcoin address where they would like to receive their MaidSafeCoins.</p>
      <h3>How will I receive my MaidSafeCoins during the crowd-sale?</h3>
      <p class="last-para">MaidSafeCoins are generated and distributed via the Master Protocol on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, so your Bitcoin address will also be your MaidSafeCoin address. In order to view your balance and send your tokens, you will need to use a Mastercoin
        wallet, such as Masterchest (for Windows) or Masterchain.info (web wallet for Mac and Linux users). These wallets will support MaidSafeCoins upon commencement of the crowd-sale.</p>
      <h3>When should I purchase MaidSafeCoins?</h3>
      <p>The crowd-sale of MaidSafeCoin has an early backer incentive mechanism. Early backers will receive additional MaidSafeCoins for their purchase on the following scale:</p>

      <table class="table half-w">
        <tr>
          <td>First Week Incentive:</td>
          <td>40% bonus</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Second Week Incentive:</td>
          <td>30% bonus</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Third Week Incentive:</td>
          <td>20% bonus</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Fourth Week Incentive:</td>
          <td>10% bonus</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p class="last-para">Up to 429,496,729 MaidSafeCoins will be generated during this crowd-sale. Once this number is reached the crowd-sale will end, so there is an incentive to become involved early.</p>
      <h3>Where can I trade my MaidSafeCoins once they are purchased?</h3>
      <p class="last-para">You will be able to exchange your MaidSafeCoins for safecoins once the SAFE Network is launched, and you will also be able to trade your MaidSafeCoins immediately upon receipt at exchanges that support MaidSafeCoin. MasterXchange.com is an exchange
        that will support MaidSafeCoin immediately once the crowd-sale has begun, so once your purchase has occurred you will be able to trade your MaidSafeCoins immediately. You will be able to send your MaidSafeCoins to any Bitcoin address (using a
        Mastercoin wallet) as soon as they are received by you.</p>
      <h3>What is the Master Protocol?</h3>
      <p>The Master Protocol, developed by the Mastercoin Foundation, facilitates the creation and trading of smart properties and user currencies as well as other types of smart contracts by encoding information directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
      <p class="last-para">The Master Protocol is decentralized, and like safecoin, “removes the middlemen” in network transactions, with a focus on transactions that occur on the Bitcoin blockchain. Mastercoin and the Master Protocol are driven by the community and leverages
        the decentralization of the network to provide value and increased functionality.</p>
